# How the Application Works
* The application begins with a start menu. The start goes to level one and the quit will exit the game. 
* In the first and second level, the user needs to pick up the gun and shoot the targets, which are white barrels. 
* The barrels need five shots to be destroyed. There are also hazards, which are rocks, that will reduce the player’s health. 
* There are health pickups and ammo pickups. Since the player only has thirty rounds to start with, they may run out if they miss the target. 
* A player will die if they go by the hazard and when it’s reduced it goes to level one. 
* The health status does not show up until damage has happened.
