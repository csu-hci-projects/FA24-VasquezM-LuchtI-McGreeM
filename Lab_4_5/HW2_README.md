# How the Application Works
* The application begins with a start menu. The start goes to level one and the quit will exit the game.
* In the first level, the user needs to find the target and shoot at it at least twice to destroy it.
* If the target is only shot once, then it will change colors.
* To keep track of the ammo and the targets, the user needs to pick up the gun.
* The number on the left of the gun in blue is the number of shots taken at the target.
* The number on the right of the gun in white is the ammo count.
* The player can grab items such as the ball, chair, and cube.
* The player can reload by pressing on A of the right controller.
* Once the player has destroyed the targets, then it is taken to the second level, the win level.
